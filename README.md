# BeffsEasyNotes
A Notepad that has tranformed into legend. From VB.net to HTML5 comes the new BeffsEasyNotes. 


Please note this is being converted and all features of the previous version will come together along the way.

#About

BeffsEasyNotes started a while ago, first by itself, then closed off so I could focus on <a href="beffsbrowser.tk">beffsbrowser</a>.
I ended up with BeffsEasyNotes as a main feature of that project and that project is being redone to a better standard. 

So...

Here we are back again, but this time instead of vb.net, this is in html5/js!


#Features

This RichTextEditor is made in HTML5 And JS using the concept of the  "contenteditable" Tag. 

It has support for most editing options:

-Bold

-Italics

-Copy/Cut/paste

-Link

Etc.
